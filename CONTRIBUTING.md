## Pull requests
If you'd like to contribute some code, please feel free to open a pull request.

Here are some tips for your PR to be successful:

* Contact the project authors beforehand with your proposal, to align on the changes needed and how you're planning to implement them.
* Avoid breaking the end user's API if not necessary.
* Align the style of your code with the code of the rest of the repository.
* Make the minimal changes necessary, for example, avoid changing parts of the code you're not touching or avoid changing code only because of style.
* Provide some proof of testing: for example, with screenshots of your code working or with unit/integration tests.
* Avoid using external libraries whenever possible.
* Read the project's license.

If you open a pull request, you're granting the project maintainers the right to use your code, under the current or any other license.
